## Algorithms of learning and planning

My research programs seeks to understand the algorithms by which intelligent agents learn and plan, and how these essential functions go awry in human worry. I leverage a deep reinforcement learning framework to develop algorithmic accounts of learning and planning. In my over 10 years of independent research, I have developed expertise in clinical psychology, cognitive science, and computational neuroscience.
