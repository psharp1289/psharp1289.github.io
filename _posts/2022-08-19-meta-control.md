Leading models of human decision-making assume humans learn forward predictions, from a given state to the outcomes that typically follow it. Here, we show that in many situations decision-making can be made more efficient by relying on backward predictions, from a given outcome to the states that typically precede it. This holds specifically in environments where the number of possible outcomes exceeds the number of possible starting states (i.e., in divergent environments), because in such environments, backward predictions can be more compactly represented than forward predictions. Correspondingly, in five preregistered experiments, we find that humans engage in backward prediction in a divergent environment, and in forward prediction in a convergent environment. Importantly, we show that such predictions are flexibly employed for single-step decisions, for multistep planning, and for real-world predictions. Thus,we establish that humans adaptively deploy forward and backward prediction in the service of efficient decision-making
