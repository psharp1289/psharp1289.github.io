Planning is a costly resource that is not always beneficial to use. How do humans infer when to intitate planning? In a new cognitive task, we quantify how humans learn to delay their planning, and use a reinforcement learning computational architecture to explain how this occurs in the brain. We show in across two tasks that humans can avail themselves of a cognitive map structure to infer when to optimally initiate planning. This involves inferring that planning action sequences from early stages do not result in a better opportunity to acquire long-term rewards. Moreover, we show that individuals who worry tend to over-plan by failing to infer when to delay their planning.
