Human must use a limited amount of resources to plan efficiently over many goals. For example, in a single day, people need to plan when they will organize their homes, how they will get their tasks for work done, how they will continue to pursue longer-term financial and social aspirations. Very broadly, we can ask whether humans tasked with using their knowledge of the world to pursue multiple goals prioritize more so goals that involve possible reward or possible punishment. According to evolutionary theory, humans may prioritize goals involving punishment because such goals may result in death in ancestral times. In work recently published in eLife, we show this is the case, and is particularly augmented in individuals who report they worry much more often.
