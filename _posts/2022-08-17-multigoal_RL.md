Human must use a limited amount of resources to plan efficiently over many goals. For example, in a single day, people need to plan when they will organize their homes, and how to pursue longer-term financial and social aspirations. We can ask whether humans prioritize more so goals that involve possible reward or possible punishment. According to evolutionary theory, humans may prioritize goals involving punishment because such goals may result in death in ancestral times. In work recently published in eLife, we show this is the case, and is particularly augmented in individuals who report they worry much more often.
