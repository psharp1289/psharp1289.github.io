<h2>How do we learn, plan, and make decisions?</h2>

<<<<<<< HEAD
<p> Trained as a computational cognitive scientist, I enjoy collaborating with scientists from different fields to understand how humans learn, plan and make decisions. I use a reinforcement learning framework to model human cognition and deep learning for optimization, prediciton and hypothesis-generation.  </p>

<p> Modelling how intelligent systems work requires transcending traditional disciplinary boundaries. In my 10+ years in research, I acquired expertise in computational neuroscience, reinforcement learning, deep learning, cognitive science and clinical psychology. I believe a computational science of intelligence can be applied to solve a range of problems, exemplified in my academic scholarship that has tackled how we rationally allocate planning resources across time and goals, how emotional states alter planning and learning, and how risk taking develops over the lifespan. </p>

<p> Currently I am funded on a two-year Fulbright Postdoctoral Fellowship at Hebrew University's Computational Cognition Lab. The objective of the Fulbright grant is to advance models of how planning resources are rationally allocated across time and goals, and how this is disrupted in individuals that chronically worry.</p>
