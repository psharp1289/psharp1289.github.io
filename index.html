<h2>How do we learn, plan, and make decisions?</h2>

<p> Trained as a computational cognitive scientist, I enjoy collaborating with scientists from different fields to understand how humans learn, plan and make decisions. I use a reinforcement learning framework to model human cognition and deep learning for optimization, prediciton and hypothesis-generation.  </p>
