<h2>How do we learn, plan, and make decisions?</h2>

<p> My philosophy throughout my 10+ years in science is to transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries to learn the ideas and skills necessary to model how intellgent systems work. This has led me to study computational neuroscience, cognitive science and clinical psychology. I leverage reinforcement learning and deep learning to explain how intelligent agents learn, plan and decide. I believe a science of intelligence can be applied to solve a range of problems. Probelms that interest me most are how learning environments shape  well-being and how emotions are part of intelligent decision-making. </p>
