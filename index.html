<h2>How do we learn, plan, and make decisions?</h2>

<p> I am computational cognitive scientist seeking to understand how humans learn and plan. I primarily use a reinforcement learning framework to develop algorithmic explanations of human learning and planning. Importantly, I am focused on how these algorithms shed light on the nature of human anxiety.  </p>
<h2></h2>

<p> I have taken a nontraditional path towards this program of research. I began in a clinical psychology PhD, moved to a devleopmental neuroscience lab to finish my PhD, and spent the past 5 years in computational cognitive science labs. To do so, I've spent time in Chapel Hill (UNC),  London (UCL), Jerusalem (Hebrew University), and now New Haven (Yale). </p>
