<h2>Using deep reinforcement learning to understand, predict, and inform decisions.</h2>
<h4> Trained as a computational cognitive neuroscientist, I am motivated by an intrinsic curioisity to collaborate wiht others across diverse fields to understand how humans learn, plan and make decisions. I take both a theory-driven and predictive approach to this enterprise, combining algorithmic modelling of cognition using a reinforcement learning framework and a use of deep learning to both for optimization, prediciton and hypothesis-generation.  </h4>
