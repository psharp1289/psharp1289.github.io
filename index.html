<h2>How do we learn, plan, and make decisions?</h2>

<p> I am computational cognitive scientist seeking to understand how humans learn, plan and make decisions using a reinforcement learning framework. I am particularly interested using this algorithmic understanding to understand the spectrum of human anxiety.  </p>
<h2></h2>

<p> I have taken a windy path towards this program of research. I began in a clinical psychology PhD, moved to a devleopmental neuroscience lab to finish my PhD, and spent the past 5 years in computational cognitive science labs around in London (UCL), Jerusalem (Hebrew University), and now New Haven (Yale). </p>

<p> Currently I am a Postdoc in the Rutledge Lab at Yale. The objective of my research is to elucidate how planning resources utlized efficiently, and how this is disrupted in individuals that chronically worry.</p>
