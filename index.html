<h2>Using deep reinforcement learning to understand, predict, and inform decisions.</h2>
<p> Trained as a computational cognitive neuroscientist, I am a deeply curious scientist seeking to collaborate wiht others across diverse fields to solve interesting problems concerning how humans learn, plan and make decisions. I believe the best science of decision making uses a combination of algorithmic modelling of cognition and predictive tools such as deep learning, to meet this objective.  </p>
