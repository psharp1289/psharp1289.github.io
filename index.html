<h2>How do we learn, plan, and make decisions?</h2>

<p> Modelling how intelligent systems work requires transcending traditional disciplinary boundaries. In my 10+ years in research, I acquired expertise in computational neuroscience, reinforcement learning, deep learning, cognitive science and clinical psychology. I believe a computational science of intelligence can be applied to solve a range of problems, exemplified in my academic scholarship that has tackled how we rationally allocate planning resources across time and goals, how emotional states alter planning and learning, and how risk taking develops over the lifespan. </p>
